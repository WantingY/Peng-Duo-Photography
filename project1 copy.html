    <h3>A Gift to the Moon</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        The Locke town, established back in 1915, located in Sacramento County, was the only town is USA built exclusively by Chinese community. 
    </p>
    <br>    
    <p>
        I can still remember how it feels like when I first got there, it was raining hard, and just like the first day I visited San Francisco. There was only one car in the public parking; the public restroom was still functioning, but with no electricity; the historical buildings, which used to be Chinese school, gambling house, theatre and boarding house, were no longer functioning, either turned into museum, or closed. There was no one sitting in the museums, as well as no one walking on the street. I walked into the first store, a traditional Chinese medicine store, expecting to see some familiar faces, but the owner Diane, doesn’t looks like a Chinese at all. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        If you ask me when this project was started, I would say from the moment I pushed the door of Moon Café Gallery.  Deborah was standing in the front desk working on her computer, Brock, Russell and Stuart was gathering in front of a 15inch television watching the Super Bowl championship. Kim and Chris weren’t there, probably because they prefer to stay at home during a rainy day, and James, was out of town for his girlfriend’s uncle’s funeral.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This probably is not a perfect story of the “historical” Locke, since nothing “significant” has been described or introduced; but as a gift in return for giving me the most wonderful days I’ve ever had during the 6 years in the states, I think they would like it.

        To the Moon Café Artists,
